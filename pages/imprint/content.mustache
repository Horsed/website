  <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
  <div>
    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we can not assume any liability for these third-party contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.<br>
