During my work on [VMOD](https://itunes.apple.com/app/vmod/id1291390392) I started using

Developing games mostly in my spare time has lead me to optimize certain aspects of my development workflow. This is especially handy when I'm working on level based puzzle games where the majoriy of the work is creating and testing levels. That being said, while the title suggests, I'm making games on my phone, I am actually making them mostly on my dev machine. It's just that some parts of my Unity games can be made without Unity and on my phone.

With this post I want to share these improvements and how they work. Here is what I'm talking about:

-All the assets (code, graphics, sfx, marketing stuff) in one place
-Automatic builds
-Remote assets (e.g. levels for puzzle games)
-Automatic deployments of the backend/website

-mono repo
-github integrations
-cloud build
-backend deployment
-remote levels
-local levels in editor
