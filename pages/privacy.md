# Privacy policy

This privacy policy was last updated on February 22th, 2021.

I neither need nor want any personally identifiable information about you, the visitory to my website or the users of my apps. Therefore I do not collect anything like that on my own. However, my games are based on Unity Â§D which itself collects data from your device. Please see the privacy policy of Unity 3D:

<a href="https://unity3d.com/de/legal/privacy-policy">https://unity3d.com/de/legal/privacy-policy</a>

In addition to that I am counting the visitors to my websites and the installations of my apps. I do the former without storing any of your personally identifiable data. For the latter, a random string is generated on your device and stored on my servers upon the first start of my apps. This string does not contain any personally identifiable data. It also can't be used to identify you or your device across my apps, since the string is purely random and only unique to a particular installation.

This privacy policy may change from time to time. If I make any material changes to my policies, I will place a prominent notice on my websites and applications.

If you have any comments or questions about this privacy policy, please email.
