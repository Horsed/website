# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for my app "2k Solitaire".

This privacy policy was last updated on August 16th, 2020.

I neither need nor want any personally identifiable information about you, the visitory to my website or the users of my apps. Therefore I do not collect anything like that on my own.

I am counting the visitors to this website and the installations of this app. I do the former without storing any of your personally identifiable data. For the latter I transfer a strong hash of your Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) to my servers upon the first start of the app, in case ad-tracking is not limited on your iOS device. If you are limiting ad-tracking, then the app doesn't use or transfer your IDFA.

However, this app contains tracking SDKs and will therefore collect data from your device. Please see the following privacy policies of my partners in order to understand what data is collected and how it will be used:

<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>

<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/privacy">https://gameanalytics.com/privacy</a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>

This privacy policy may change from time to time. If I make any material changes to my policies, I will place a prominent notice on this website and app.</p>
