## Disclaimer
As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these Internet pages under § 7 (1) TMG and according to the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as service providers are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or investigate circumstances which indicate an illicit activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with the general laws remain unaffected. Any liability in this respect is, however, only incurred from the moment that knowledge of the specific breach of law is obtained. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove these contents immediately.

## Liability for Links
Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we can not assume any liability for these third-party contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.

However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of an infringement. We will remove such links immediately, if we become aware of any legal infringements.
